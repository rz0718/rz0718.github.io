## Key Concepts

### To communicate better
- Keep it short
- Uses simple words
- Focus on the audiences 

### Two types of presentations
- Informative 
- Persuasive

### Four steps to answer questions 
- Understand the question 
- Describe the question using your own words which can help you to think about it more deeply
- Answer the question and restate your opinion 
- Ask if there is anything else you can help with

### Handle difficult conversations
- Acknowledge the other person's feelings
- Relate to the other person's feelings (show that you understand their point of view)
- Translate and help to provide a solution

### To conduct an effective meeting
- Set the tone
- Confirm the purpose of the meeting
- Gather current information
- Discuss your ideas
- Discuss the benefits of the ideas
- Establish action items

## Notable Quotes

> "Your job as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your job is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can."

This quote fundamentally changed my view of management - it's about leverage and enabling others, not being the best individual contributor.

### On Decision Making
> "The first big part of making good decisions is being clear about what you're optimizing for."

This reminds me of the importance of having clear principles and priorities when making decisions.

## Personal Takeaways

1. **Trust is Foundation**: Building trust through consistent behavior and genuine care is crucial
2. **Process Matters**: Good processes make good outcomes repeatable and scalable
3. **Feedback is a Gift**: Regular, specific feedback is key to team growth. Esepcially for me, I need to embrace conflict and give hard feedback in real-time.
4. **Context over Control**: Providing clear context helps team make better decisions independently

## Applications

As I continue to grow in my leadership role:
- Implement regular 1:1s with a clear structure
- Try to give feedback in real-time
- Focus on providing context and "why" behind decisions
- Encourage open communication
- Develop processes that scale with team growth

It is a pretty practical book for me to learn how to be a better manager.]]></content><author><name>Rui Zhao</name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">你好鼓鼓</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blogs/2024/12/23/%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%90%E5%BF%83.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="你好鼓鼓" /><published>2024-12-23T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2024-12-23T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blogs/2024/12/23/%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%90%E5%BF%83</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blogs/2024/12/23/%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%90%E5%BF%83.html"><![CDATA[<p>鼓鼓小朋友，你好啊。今天是来到我们的身边的第四天，我刚刚一个人开车去帮你看看明天的大使馆怎么停车方便，因为爸爸不想让你和今天一样去医院，因为我在找路等太久。今天也是平安夜，在去的路上，我路过的tanglin mall, 那边有很大的圣诞树。想起来你的妈妈还在卧床休息，因为生产是很辛苦的，还有你也因为太小，当然也不能出来。所以我就突然好期待明年的这个时候，你可以陪爸爸妈妈一起过节。希望你一定要健健康康的长大哦。我和你的妈妈一开始很希望你可以2025年的1月1号后在出来，这样你可以是你们同班同学的大朋友，但你却在12月20号就迫不及待的跑出来，我知道你一定是想和爸爸妈妈多过一些节日，谢谢你，鼓鼓。</p>

<p>另外在你出生的第二天，还在医院的时候，也就是12月21号的早上，我抱着你，看着小小的你闭着眼睛，我不知道为什么脑海中，冒出了下面的一段旋律</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“仿佛如同一场梦 我们如此短暂的相逢 你像一阵春风 轻轻柔柔吹入我心中”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>真的像一场梦一样，你就这样来到了我们的身边，轻轻柔柔的。</p>

<p>这是你的第一个清晨，你妈妈还是熟睡，你也在熟睡，我很幸福也很幸运。谢谢你，鼓鼓，还有你薏米。</p>

Here are some reflections on what I've learned and how it has shaped my own understanding of the field.

## The Challenge of Teaching ML

Teaching machine learning presents those challenges:
- Bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications
- Keeping up with rapid developments in the field
- Making complex concepts accessible to students
- Balancing depth with breadth

## What Students Taught Me

My students have taught me as much as I've taught them:
1. The importance of empathy and patience
2. The value of practical examples
3. The power of learning through teaching
4. The engagement of the students bring more joy to teaching

And also, I found master students are more engaged and than undergrads.

<h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="system-1-vs-system-2">System 1 vs System 2</h3>
<ul>
  <li>System 1: Fast, automatic, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious</li>

<h3 id="applications-in-trading">Applications in Trading</h3>

<p>As a quantitative trader, I find the concepts particularly relevant:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understanding cognitive biases in market behavior</li>
  <li>Recognizing when to trust intuition vs. analysis</li>
  <li>Designing systems that account for human psychology</li>
</ol>
