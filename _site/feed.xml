<p>另外在你出生的第二天，还在医院的时候，也就是12月21号的早上，我抱着你，看着小小的你闭着眼睛，我不知道为什么脑海中，冒出了下面的一段旋律</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“仿佛如同一场梦 我们如此短暂的相逢 你像一阵春风 轻轻柔柔吹入我心中”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>真的像一场梦一样，你就这样来到了我们的身边，轻轻柔柔的。</p>

<p>这是你的第一个清晨，你妈妈还是熟睡，你也在熟睡，我很幸福也很幸运。谢谢你，鼓鼓，还有你薏米。</p>

As someone who has experienced the challenges of leading teams, I found her insights particularly relevant and actionable.</p>

<h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="a-great-team">A great team</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Process, Purpose, People</li>
  <li>As a manager, you need to focus on the above three things to build a great team</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-great-manager">What Makes a Great Manager</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your job is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together</li>
  <li>Success is measured by the success of your team</li>
  <li>Focus on building trust, setting clear context, and giving actionable feedback</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-first-three-months">The First Three Months</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Build trust with your team through 1:1s</li>
  <li>Learn as much as you can about the team’s work and processes</li>
  <li>Don’t rush to make changes - observe and understand first</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="giving-feedback">Giving Feedback</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Make feedback specific and actionable</li>
  <li>Focus on observations, not interpretations</li>
  <li>Make it a regular practice, not just during performance reviews</li>
  <li>Balance positive and constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Provide expectations and goals. Team members need to know what is expected of them and how they can achieve it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notable-quotes">Notable Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your job as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your job is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote fundamentally changed my view of management - it’s about leverage and enabling others, not being the best individual contributor.</p>

<h3 id="on-decision-making">On Decision Making</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The first big part of making good decisions is being clear about what you’re optimizing for.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me of the importance of having clear principles and priorities when making decisions.</p>

<h2 id="personal-takeaways">Personal Takeaways</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trust is Foundation</strong>: Building trust through consistent behavior and genuine care is crucial</li>
  <li><strong>Process Matters</strong>: Good processes make good outcomes repeatable and scalable</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback is a Gift</strong>: Regular, specific feedback is key to team growth. Esepcially for me, I need to embrace conflict and give hard feedback in real-time.</li>
  <li><strong>Context over Control</strong>: Providing clear context helps team make better decisions independently</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>As I continue to grow in my leadership role:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement regular 1:1s with a clear structure</li>
  <li>Try to give feedback in real-time</li>
  <li>Focus on providing context and “why” behind decisions</li>
  <li>Encourage open communication</li>
  <li>Develop processes that scale with team growth</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a pretty practical book for me to learn how to be a better manager.</p>]]></content><author><name>Rui Zhao</name></author><category term="notes" /><category term="leadership" /><category term="management" /><category term="career development" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key insights from Julie Zhuo's practical guide to navigating the transition into management]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Book Notes: Simply Said</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/notes/2024/09/20/simply-said.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Book Notes: Simply Said" /><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/notes/2024/09/20/simply-said</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/notes/2024/09/20/simply-said.html"><![CDATA[<p>Jay Sullivan’s “Simply Said” is a practical guide to improve communication at work and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="to-communicate-better">To communicate better</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep it short</li>
  <li>Uses simple words</li>
  <li>Focus on the audiences</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="two-types-of-presentations">Two types of presentations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Informative</li>
  <li>Persuasive</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="four-steps-to-answer-questions">Four steps to answer questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the question</li>
  <li>Describe the question using your own words which can help you to think about it more deeply</li>
  <li>Answer the question and restate your opinion</li>
  <li>Ask if there is anything else you can help with</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="handle-difficult-conversations">Handle difficult conversations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Acknowledge the other person’s feelings</li>

  <li>Discuss your ideas</li>
  <li>Discuss the benefits of the ideas</li>
  <li>Establish action items</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notable-quotes">Notable Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If we want to improve our ability to connect with others, to understand them and to be understood more claerly, the easiest and most effective way  to do so is to focus less on ourselves and more on the other person.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This follows my philosophy of being more empathetic and understanding others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you talk to a larger audience, you have one of two objectives: you either want them to know something or you want them to do something.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good reminder for me to be more concise and target-oriented when talking to a larger audience. Especially when you prepare a presentation, you need to think about what you want the audience to know or do after the presentation.</p>

<h2 id="personal-takeaways">Personal Takeaways</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Less Self-focused</strong>: Self-focused communication is about you and your ideas which leads to miscommunication. Audience-focused communication is about the other person and their needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Tips for Clear Message</strong>: Short, Simple words, focused on the needs of the audience.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Persuasive Format</strong>:

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informative Format</strong>:
