## About Me

Currently, I work in a fintech company, where I lead teams working on machine learning applications in finance. And also I do some work related to tresaury and capital markets.

I am also passionate about teaching and currently delivering courses in machine learning and data science.

My current research interests are:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Agentic AI
- Quantitative Trading
- Natural Language Processing
- Financial Technology
- Big Data Analytics

## About This Site

This is my playground where I:
- Share technical insights about AI, machine learning, and quantitative trading
- Record my reading notes and reflections
- Write about my thoughts and experiences

The site serves as both a personal knowledge base and a platform to share what I've learned with others. Yeah, this is my own rambling corner.
