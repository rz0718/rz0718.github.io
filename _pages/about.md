## About Me

Currently, I work in a fintech company, where I lead teams working on machine learning applications. But most of my time spent there is crunching numbers for treasury.

I am also passionate about teaching and currently delivering a few courses in machine learning and data science.

My current research interests are:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Agentic AI
- Quantitative Trading
- Natural Language Processing
- Financial Technology
- Big Data Analytics

## About This Site

This is my playground where I:
- Share technical insights about AI, machine learning, and quantitative trading
- Record my reading notes and reflections
- Write about my thoughts and experiences

The site serves as both a personal knowledge base and a platform to share what I've learned with others. Yeah, this is my own rambling corner.
