Recenty, I came across the presentation made by Andrew NG and as shown in the screenshot below, he mentioned that the next frontier of AI is agent. In his talk, he mentioned that the current state of AI interatction (like chatGPT) essentially asking an AI to complete a task in one go is limited. Than, the agentic workflow which would be a paradigm shift will be a more effective approach for AI problem-sovling. Instead of seeking a perfect output in a signle attempt, the method would invovle:
1. Breaking down the task into smaller sub-tasks and multiple steps
2. Allowing the AI to research, draft, and review
3. Implement iterative improvement cycles

And also the fundation model company: Anthropic just dropped an incredible guide on "How To Build Effective Agents" and in that article, they mentioned that 2025 will be the year of AGENTS. Therefore, we are going to dive into the topic of AI agent in this blog.
