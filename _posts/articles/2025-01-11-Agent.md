Recenty, I came across the presentation made by Andrew NG and as shown in the screenshot below, he mentioned that the next frontier of AI is agent. In his talk, he mentioned that the current state of AI interatction (like chatGPT) essentially asking an AI to complete a task in one go is limited. Than, the agentic workflow which would be a paradigm shift will be a more effective approach for AI problem-sovling. Instead of seeking a perfect output in a signle attempt, the method would invovle:
1. Breaking down the task into smaller sub-tasks and multiple steps
2. Allowing the AI to research, draft, and review
3. Implement iterative improvement cycles

And also the fundation model company: Anthropic just dropped an incredible guide on "How To Build Effective Agents" and in that article, they mentioned that 2025 will be the year of AGENTS. Therefore, we are going to dive into the topic of AI agent in this blog.

## What is an Agent?

In the early days of LLM, we solve tasks by passing the task to the LLM and directy using the model's output as the answer to that problem. Now, we are moving towards the agentic workflow where we break down the task into smaller sub-tasks and multiple steps. For example, in chatGPT UI, we can prompt it and it will return a blog post about AI agent. But in the agentic workflow, we would break down the task into smaller sub-tasks and multiple steps. For example, the search tool would be called to query the relevant and recent information about AI agent, and then those information would be used by the LLM to write the blog post. After the draft is ready, the LLM would review the draft and then the final blog post would be returned. In the AI agent, the LLM is the brain that processes the task, plans a sequence of actions to complete the task, aggregate the results, and determines whether the task has been accomplished. By augmenting the LLM's capabilities, three components are added to the agent:
1. Tools: any function that the agent can use to complete the task
2. Planning: the capability of the agent to plan a sequence of actions to complete the task
3. Memory: short-term and long-term memory containing any information that the agent might need to reason about the actions it needs to take

### Tools

LLM is good at generation. Therefore, external tools can make agents having more capabilities. Tools help an agent to interact with the environment better by providing them both reading and writing capabilities. For example, 

#### Reading capabilities

The agent can use the tool to read the information from the environment. The retriver tools, SQL exectuor, API call and web browing are all examples of reading tools. Those tools can allow the agent to have the more accurate and up-to-date information. 

#### Capability extension

Tools can also help overcome inherent model limitations. For example, while models often struggle with complex math, providing a calculator tool offers an easy solution. Similarly, tools like calendars, unit converters, and code interpreters can significantly enhance model capabilities. Tools can also enable multimodal interactions - a text-only model can leverage image generation tools like DALL-E, or use OCR and transcription tools to process different input types. Research has shown that tool-augmented models consistently outperform base models, with improvements of over 10% on various benchmarks.

#### Write actions

Beyond read-only capabilities, tools can perform write actions that modify data sources - like SQL executors updating tables or email APIs sending responses. These write capabilities enable powerful automation workflows, from customer outreach to order processing.

Write actions significantly expand what AI systems can do autonomously, but they also introduce risks. Just as you wouldn't give unrestricted database access to an intern, careful consideration must be given to what write permissions an AI system receives. Proper security measures and trust validation are crucial when implementing write-enabled tools.
