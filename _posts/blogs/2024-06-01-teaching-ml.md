excerpt: "Personal reflections and lessons learned from teaching machine learning at NUS."
---

Teaching machine learning at the National University of Singapore has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my career. Here are some reflections on what I've learned and how it has shaped my own understanding of the field.

## The Challenge of Teaching ML

Teaching machine learning presents those challenges:
- Bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications
- Keeping up with rapid developments in the field
- Making complex concepts accessible to students
- Balancing depth with breadth

## What Students Taught Me

My students have taught me as much as I've taught them:
1. The importance of empathy and patience
2. The value of practical examples
3. The power of learning through teaching
4. The engagement of the students bring more joy to teaching

And also, I found master students are more engaged and than undergrads. Maybe I should learn more about how to talk with Gen-Z.
