"Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman is a fascinating exploration of how our minds work and the two systems that drive our thinking: the fast, intuitive System 1 and the slow, deliberate System 2.

## Key Concepts

### System 1 vs System 2
- System 1: Fast, automatic, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious
- System 2: Slow, effortful, logical, calculating, conscious

### Applications in Trading

As a quantitative trader, I find the concepts particularly relevant:
1. Understanding cognitive biases in market behavior
2. Recognizing when to trust intuition vs. analysis
3. Designing systems that account for human psychology
