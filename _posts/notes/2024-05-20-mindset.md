## Key Concepts

### Mindset
- Growth mindset is the belief that we can improve and grow through learning and effort.
- Fixed mindset is the belief that we are limited by our current abilities and cannot change.

### How to cultivate a growth mindset
- What are the opportunities for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me?
- When, where and how will I embrak on my plan?
- When, where and how will I act on my new plan?
- What do I have to do to maintain and continue the growth?

### As parents, teachers, and coaches
- Our mission is developing people's potential
- Instead of focusing on results or outcomes, we should focus on the process of learning and growth. Not ask for win, but ask for full commitment and full efforts.

## Personal Takeaways

1. Growth mindset is the belief that we can improve and grow through learning and effort. It is not only related to your own growth, but also related to the growth of the people around you.
2. I am thinking is it too simplified to contribute everything to mindset. I guess the life journey has more factors than just mindset.
