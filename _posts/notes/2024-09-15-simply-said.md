## Notable Quotes

> "Your job as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your job is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can."

This quote fundamentally changed my view of management - it's about leverage and enabling others, not being the best individual contributor.

### On Decision Making
> "The first big part of making good decisions is being clear about what you're optimizing for."

This reminds me of the importance of having clear principles and priorities when making decisions.

## Personal Takeaways

1. **Trust is Foundation**: Building trust through consistent behavior and genuine care is crucial
2. **Process Matters**: Good processes make good outcomes repeatable and scalable
3. **Feedback is a Gift**: Regular, specific feedback is key to team growth. Esepcially for me, I need to embrace conflict and give hard feedback in real-time.
4. **Context over Control**: Providing clear context helps team make better decisions independently

## Applications

As I continue to grow in my leadership role:
- Implement regular 1:1s with a clear structure
- Try to give feedback in real-time
- Focus on providing context and "why" behind decisions
- Encourage open communication
- Develop processes that scale with team growth

It is a pretty practical book for me to learn how to be a better manager.
