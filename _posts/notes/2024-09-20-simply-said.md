## Notable Quotes

> "If we want to improve our ability to connect with others, to understand them and to be understood more claerly, the easiest and most effective way  to do so is to focus less on ourselves and more on the other person."

This follows my philosophy of being more empathetic and understanding others.

> "When you talk to a larger audience, you have one of two objectives: you either want them to know something or you want them to do something."

This is a good reminder for me to be more concise and target-oriented when talking to a larger audience. Especially when you prepare a presentation, you need to think about what you want the audience to know or do after the presentation.


## Personal Takeaways

1. **Less Self-focused**: Self-focused communication is about you and your ideas which leads to miscommunication. Audience-focused communication is about the other person and their needs.
2. **Tips for Clear Message**: Short, Simple words, focused on the needs of the audience.
3. **Persuasive Format**:

5. **Handle Difficult Conversations**: three steps called ART (acknowledge, relate, translate)
- ACKNOWLEDGE: Acknowledge the other person's feelings
  - I appreciate/understand.share + your feelings (frustraction, concern, concern, etc) + real stuffs
- RELATE: Relate to the other person's feelings
  - I also felt like you do/ I too have felt that way
- TRANSLATE: Translate and help to provide a solution

The book is super clear and I should read it again and again to remind myself.
